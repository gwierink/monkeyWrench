1. Automatically calculate turbulence properties
..* Use inline calculations to compute turbulence properties automatically.
..* Also an example how to use substitutions and patchGroups to compact boundary
    files
..* Example case: tutorials/incompressible/pimpleFoam/pitzDaily
..* Disclaimer: This is nothing new, just some useful things that are available
    in OpenFOAM, collected in one tutorial for efficient case set-up.

2. Mesh narrow slots using snappyHexMesh
..* A basic example of two narrow slots close to one another, meshed using
    snappyHexMesh. Sometimes planar surfaces or narrow slots tend to be
    castallated and not properly snapped. This case shows an example of
    how to do this.
